          <div class="project-body">
            <p>Horiseon webpage from homework week one.  The Horiseon website tells users about 3 topics:
              1. Search Engine Optimization
              2. Online Reputation Management
              3. Social Media Marketing
              
              It also provides a list of Benefits of doing these 3 things.
              
              This project was to remove redundant items in the Html file and the CSS file while still retaining the look of the website.
              
              Part of the challenge was also to make sure that it followed Html Semantic elements.</p>
