# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Task

I was to create a webpage that provided a glimpse in the projects I have completed to date.

I made room to include four projects:
   1. Cheesy Puff Game, 
   2. Spaceman Invader Game, 
   3. Horiseon web page, 
   4. Placeholder for a fourth project

I included sections for:
    About Me Inforamtion, 
    Contact Information, 
    Link to my Resume

## Have I met the criteria of the assignment?

1. GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
2. WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
3. WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation - **completed**
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section - **completed**
4. WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications - **completed**
5. WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others - **not completed**
6. WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application - **completed**
